          <p>The virtual reality world is something that can be really complex. It requires a lot of skill. It gives a really good pay and for some people it's the job they have fun doing. Around 171 million people use virtual reality in some form today. It can be really expensive, but it can also be really worth it. VR and AR often get confused for each other. VR builds the world in which we emerse ourselves into with a headset. AR is when our own world is in the framework with objects, images, and other things are placed.</p>
