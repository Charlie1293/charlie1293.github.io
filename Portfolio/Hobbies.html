                <li class="list-group-item">Basketball-I have loved basketball from the moment I was old enough to understand television. The art of it and just watching how people play it is amazing to me. My favorite players are Stephen curry and Darius Garland. <img src="Media/dg.jpeg" width="150" height="150"></img></li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Football- Unlike basketball, I just more recently started to watch football. My favorite team is the bears and my favortie players are Justin Fields and DJ Moore. <img src="Media/fieldmoore.jpeg" width="150" height="150"></img></li>
                <li class="list-group-item">collecting Vinyls- I have been collecting them for about 6 months now. MY favorite one that I currently have is Good Kid Maad City by kendrick Lamar. Everything sounds so much better on vinyl! <img src="Media/vinyl.webp" width="150" height="150"></img></li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Video games-I have loved video games since I was 5. Games have only kept on developing and getting better year by year, which is what makes it so fun. My favorite games ever are Batman: Arkham Knight and Madden. <img src="Media/batman.jpeg" height="150" width="150"> </img></li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Collecting shoes- I have always wanted to collect shoes, but I just recently started last year. My favorite shoe brands currently are new balances , Asic's, and timberlands.</li>

          <div class="col-lg-12 bg-light"><p>Most of these hobbies are things I have been doing since I was little. These things get me excited, get me to calm down, and just get me to be overall happy. I love all of these hobbies and will probably countinue doing them forever. My favorite would have to be collecting vinyls. These are all really good though. I got most of these hobbies from hanging around family members that do the same thing. My longest one is watching basketball. My favorite team is the bulls. </p></div>
